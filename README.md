# Lia-Plus-Ai
This project demonstrates advanced prompt engineering techniques using Google Gemini Pro to create a domain-specific AI assistant for nursing admissions. It focuses on crafting intelligent, context-aware prompts that enable the AI to respond accurately to real-world queries.

Features


Decision-based interaction: The AI assistant uses yes/no decisions to guide users.

Eligibility check: Verifies if the student studied Biology in 12th.

Fee structure and hostel details: Provides cost breakdown and living facility info.

Clinical training & recognition: Mentions hospital training and INC Delhi recognition.

Scholarships: Lists government and Labour Ministry-based financial support.

Admission criteria: Covers entrance exam, age, and seat availability.



Prompt Engineering Approach
Zero-shot to few-shot conversational flows based on human-like query understanding.

Prompts are hardcoded rule-based, without model training.

Designed using conventional AI logic (if-else trees, flow control).



Technologies Used
Prompt Design 

Flowchart tools (e.g., draw.io, Lucidchart)

Domain knowledge from Nursing Admissions

Basic scripting (optional: Python for CLI prototype)


Visual Flow

Use Case
This assistant can be deployed at educational counseling desks or websites to:

Assist students interactively.

Provide standard responses without training datasets.

Reduce counselor workload via automation.
